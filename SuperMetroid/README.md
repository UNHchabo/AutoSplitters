# LiveSplit.SuperMetroid

This script can be used with [LiveSplit](http://livesplit.github.io) for speedrunning Super Metroid.

## Supported emulators:
- higan v102 through v110
- bsnes v107 through v112, and v115
- Snes9x 1.53 through 1.60 (win32 or win32-x64)
- RetroArch 1.7.5 (x86-64) (with Snes9x or higan cores)
- BizHawk 2.3 through 2.3.2 (with bsnes core)
- lsnes rr2-Î²23 (with bsnes v085 compatibility core)

## Setup
After you select your splits, add a start time from the list below, because the autostart event happens as the screen is finished fading to black, rather than the typical RTA start point when the screen starts fading.

- Standard NTSC: 0.29 seconds
- Standard PAL: 0.35 seconds
- Zebes start NTSC: 0.70 seconds
- Zebes start PAL: 0.84 seconds

Due to the way that the autosplitters work in LiveSplit, any setting that's chosen in the Settings menu must also have its parent selected. So to split on Morphing Ball, you must also have Misc Upgrades selected.

If you're playing a category that might reset to a save, you'll likely want to disable the "reset" option.

I recommend binding easily-accessible keys to the "Undo Split" and "Skip Split" functions, in case you skip an item or grab an extra item, or encounter a bug.

## Split events
This script supports splitting on a wide range of events, so it basically splits as often as you'd like. By default the following events will cause a split:
- First Power Bomb pickup
- Varia Suit
- Gravity Suit
- Wave Beam
- Defeating Ridley
- Entering the Statues Room, aka "Golden Four"
- Finishing Mother Brain's second phase
- Entering the ship during the Zebes Escape sequence

However, in the settings you can also select the script to split on many other things:
- Every Missile, Super Missile, or Power Bomb pickup
- All Energy Tanks
- All equippable upgrades
- All minibosses
- All bosses
- Entering miniboss or boss rooms
- Elevator transitions
- Major door transitions
- The end of In-Game Time, when used in conjunction with the [Alternate Timing Method](https://github.com/Dalet/LiveSplit.AlternateTimingMethod/releases) component
- The end of a Spore Spawn RTA run
- The end of a 100 Missile RTA run

If all of these options are selected, then a typical KPDR Any% route would have more than 50 splits!
